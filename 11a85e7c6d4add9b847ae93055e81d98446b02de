Most of these libraries seem unnecessary, aren't they shared library dependencies of other modules that will cause them to be installed?  Only dlopen'd libraries would need to be listed here.

I can't talk to that. See the comment above, maybe it's just to really really ensure things.

Who loads this library?  Would it be better to add it as a LOCAL_REQUIRED_MODULES of that module?

No.

The runtime will load this when it is asked to, but it is not a requirement of the runtime. ART works just fine without TI. (In fact TI is just a regular plugin when it comes to internals.)

Adding it here is identical in function to adding it as a LOCAL_REQUIRED_MODULES to another module, with the extra benefit that you can tell what wants it to be installed.

But it is not a required module for ART, that's the point.

It's required for a functioning phone wrt/ O release. But it is wrong to declare that dependency for the ART module, because ART does not require this functionality.

is is true this is not required for ART, it is optional.
