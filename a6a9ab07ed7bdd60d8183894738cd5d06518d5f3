Looks like this $(shell) is executed before generating the ninja file, while the ones I replaced are deferred to when the build recipe is executed. We can do this only if this $(shell) doesn't depend on any build output. What's the Kati magic here?
I don't think we can replace this $(shell).

Dan, does assert-max-image-size still make sense given that we have moved to ext4fs and beyond?

(I would write the whole assert-max-image-size using a python script in the first place instead of the mixed makefile and shell scripts.)
