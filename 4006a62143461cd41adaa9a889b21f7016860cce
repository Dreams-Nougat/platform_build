The build system doesn't like you to pass in a custom --proto_path: it must be $(TOP). The --proto_path option of protoc could affect the path of the output .pb.cc/.pb.h files, see http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/reference/cpp-generated.html#invocation. If we allow the module to set different --proto_path, it will be very hard for the build system to figure out the correct path of the output .pb.cc/.pb.h. It's critical for the build system to know the exact locations of a c++ source file when the makefile is parsed.
