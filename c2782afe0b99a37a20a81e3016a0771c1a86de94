Just a note - not an objection: Are you planning to use GOMA_HERMETIC=fallback on the bot? I'm not sure if error-for-developers-and-fallback-for-bot config is the best. Considering the motivation of bots is to find build failures before the build of end-developers fails, IMO fallback-for-developers-and-error-for-bots is the best option (fyi, this is how Chromium's build system is configured). However, I also understand setting GOMA_HERMETIC=error on bots would be troublesome before goma on bots becomes stable. Maybe setting GOMA_HERMETIC=fallback by default would be an option, but I'm not sure.
