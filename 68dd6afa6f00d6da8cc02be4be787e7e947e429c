My only problem with this change is that we aren't regenerating out/soong/.soong.bootstrap for any affected users, since we only run this target if out/soong/soong doesn't exist, which it will.

CleanSpec.mk won't help, since we don't get that far.

I could change this rule to make $(SOONG_OUT_DIR)/.soong.bootstrap depend on bootstrap.bash, so that anytime bootstrap.bash is updated, then we re-run bootstrap, but that's not strictly necessary. And ideally, we'd want to re-run it any time SOONG_OUT_DIR changes.
