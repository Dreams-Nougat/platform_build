Unfortunately this won't work in incremental build between user and eng/userdbug build: compilation flag change won't trigger rebuild with the current build system.
Our build server does incremental user build on top of userdebug build. That means user build will get the binaries built with "-g" as  well.
In general, basing comilation flags on TARGET_BUILD_VARIANT doesn't work in incremental build with the current build system.
