This breaks if multiple vendorsetup.sh files are included (in the goog tree, there are several), so this won't really work. 

I'd rather find a way to add whatever you need to the build system proper.  I think you should probably be able to accomplish anything you need by defining a new product for the different types of builds you're trying to do.  Is there anything other that couldn't be accomplished with additional product spec files?
