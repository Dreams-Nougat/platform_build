Nit:
I don't think this one is necessary. Make is already stripping the start of values when they are assigned:

A := B
<$A> is <B>

only
A := " B"
would not lead to starting space not stripped: <$A> is < B> but in this case I'd say it's intentional and does not require striping.

$(strip ...) is still necessary in the ifneq (,...) because make is not striping the end of variable assignations:
A := B # A comment
<$A> is <B >

You can replace the whole block with:
jacoco_filter_properties += $(addprefix,-D jack.coverage.jacoco.include=,$(LOCAL_JACK_COVERAGE_INCLUDE_FILTER))
