it seems strange these just don't agree with the TARGET_CPU above. Presumably we could build arm code (ie not 64-bit) with armv8 as a variant. There are instructions in armv8 beyond even what's in cortex-a15 iirc.

We wanted to use the exactly same configuration of 32-bit arm build for the second arch.

What is "exactly same configuration" ? The variant here has neon while the normal BoardConfig.mk doesn't. As Aarch64 implies Arm64 implies armv8 then I think the right options are:
TARGET_2ND_ARCH_VARIANT := armv8-a
TARGET_2ND_CPU_VARIANT := armv8-a

The configurations in build/core/combo.
With armv8-a for the second arch, it won't bulid, for we don't have armv8-a.mk in build/core/combo/arch/arm/. Also I don't know if the 32-bit toolchain knows armv8-a as arch variant and cpu variant.
