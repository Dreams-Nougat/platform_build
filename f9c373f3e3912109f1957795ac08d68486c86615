I don't like adding these ifs all over the place.  Can this go into build/core/combo somewhere?

Can those define STRIPPER and STRIPPER_COMMAND, where STRIPPER is the binary (the same as SOSLIM) for dependency purposes, and STRIPPER_COMMAND is the commandline that's run?  Alternatively, could we write a script that converts the arguments for the alternate strippers?

What is this for anyway?
