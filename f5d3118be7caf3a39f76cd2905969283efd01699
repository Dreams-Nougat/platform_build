Those TARGET_* variables are not supposed to be set in product configuration files.

These would stay in the final version.  I considered renaming them to PRODUCT_* and using PRODUCT.$(INTERNAL_PRODUCT).PRODUCT_SUPPORTS_64_BIT_APPS, but that seemed unnecessary since we don't need any inheritance overriding these variables.  I can do it that way if you prefer.
