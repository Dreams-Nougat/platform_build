I'd argue that they shouldn't be marked as shared libraries, since they don't match the build system's definition of a shared library. AFAICT, the only thing it's giving you is the install path, and we could define the install path for a different class too.

Maybe this should be moved to dynamic_binary.mk now that we don't support host modules. That file definitely shouldn't be used except for elf files.
