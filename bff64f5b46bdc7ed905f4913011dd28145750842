Isn't glob_dict["build.prop"] already a dict object? see build/tools/releasetools/common.py:
d["build.prop"] = LoadBuildProp(read_helper)

This file is using a locally defined LoadGlobalDict. And, no, the contents of the glob_dict["build.prop"] is a string object, not a dictionary. LoadGlobalDict does:

  def LoadGlobalDict(filename):
  ...
  v = line.split("=", 1)
  ...

And the input file contains a line on this format:

  build.prop={'ro.build.date.utc': 1418245729}

line.split will result in a string that is stored in glob_dict.

This string needs to be parsed into a dictionary object.

LoadGlobalDict() in this file loads the dictionary generated by generate-userimage-prop-dictionary in build/core/Makefile and it doesn't contain build.prop.
build.prop is loaded only when ImagePropFromGlobalDict() is called by add_img_to_target_files.py, for which the dictionary is loaded by build/tools/releasetools/common.py.
