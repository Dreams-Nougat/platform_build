Just out of curiosity, it seems the symlink permission on Linux should always be 0o777 (http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/symlink.7.html). Do we have any counter case somewhere?

(And the other change below actually makes no difference other than the wrong comment.)

It seems that's not the the case on Mac.
I changed IsRegular() to use the same pattern as this.

Thanks, Ying. That sounds reasonable. I've never tried running the scripts on Mac though.

I'll verify and sbumit the CL.
