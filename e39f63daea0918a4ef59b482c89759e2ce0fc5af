I have some concern with this change. Currently otatools.zip package is needed by the OTA server to generate incremental OTA packages. We can define "TARGET_SKIP_OTA_PACKAGE := true" for a device that doesn't need the otatools.zip. But for future A/B updater, we may still want to do that (just to pack a different set of tools instead). So can we remove L1317-1319 but add "TARGET_SKIP_OTA_PACKAGE := true" to board config file?

Done.  I've added TARGET_SKIP_OTA_PACKAGE to our base mk with http://ag/#/c/783580/.  If future A/B updater requires some set of ota tools installed, we can remove it from there easily.
