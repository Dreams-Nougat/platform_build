This won't work. This is a global configuration loaded well before any Android.mk gets loaded. So at this point the module-scoped LOCAL_CPPFLAGS isn't defined.

Maybe you can use "LOCAL_NO_DEFAULT_COMPILER_FLAGS := true" in libc++'s module definition, so the build system will skip any global flags. If you still need some global flags, you can add them with LOCAL_CFLAGS_<arch_name> in the Android.mk.
