I think you need to pass in the new flag "--signapk_shared_library_path " from here.

I'd suggest to rename it to SIGAPK_JNI_LIBRARY_PATH .

This is incorrect. What bitness to use is decided by the JDK's bitness, not how we build the host binaries. There is a build system variable HOST_JDK_IS_64BIT_VERSION for this. But I don't think we need to care about 32-bit JDK any more at this point. So we can just remove the 32bit support here.

Same here. We don't need to support 32-bit JDK.
