I initially added the LOCAL_ADDITIONAL_DEPENDENCIES when I hit a build error on no dependency to make the header file. However, I can no longer reproduce that error, so I dropped it.

I was confident I encountered it before when executing:
$ make -j8 fs_config_files

On angler and shamu it works without this, but on bullhead it dies. Weird I am seeing inconsistencies between them.
