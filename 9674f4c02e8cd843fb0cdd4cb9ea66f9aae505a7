If we're going to create a dalvik property, I would prefer this be in external/sepolicy. Dalvik properties are not specific to the emulator.

Agreed, except that on the non-emulator these properties are never set in this way.  qemu-props seems to read out a list of boot properties from the emulator and set anything in the list, so potentially any property could end up being set here (e.g. using the -prop option to the emulator).  I originally was just going to allow setting anything in property_type (as with init, which previously qemu-props ran in), but this is now prohibited by neverallow in external/sepolicy for anything other than init.
