Instead of adding a ifndef in the middle of this recipe I think you should break out everything to this line into something like a BUILT_RECOVERYRAMDISK_TARGET (like BUILT_RAMDISK_TARGET) and then wrap the entire INSTALLED_RECOVERYIMAGE_TARGET in your ifndef.

That way the BOARD_CUSTOM_BOOTIMG_MK can define it's own rules for how to make INSTALLED_RECOVERYIMAGE_TARGET -- like you do for INSTALLED_BOOTIMAGE_TARGET.

If you do it like this it's harder to read and you will have a make rule that doesn't produce it's target file.
