Don't test and tweak commands in this function.
Have something like

      gdbwrapper -x "$OUT..."
      ...
   }
   function gdbwrapper() {
       $ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN/$GDB "$@"
   }

This will allow people to setup the env, and override the gdbwrapper at will for any gdb-style wrappers.

   . build/envsetup.sh
   function gdbwrapper() { ddd --debugger $ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN/$GDB "$@" ; }

Is your preference is that 'ddd' support isn't built-in, and instead needs to be defined by the user after sourcing the build environment?  Or do you only object to the way that I accomplished building it in?

Assume that there are 2000 different clients: your method fails to scale, and is unusable for the 1998 more obscure clients.

The solution I'm suggesting allows the 1998 other clients to benefit from only changing one function in their env after envsetup.sh.
