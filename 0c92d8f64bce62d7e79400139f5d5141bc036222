Now boot.art is built to the staging directory $(DEXPREOPT_BOOT_JAR_DIR_FULL_PATH), which is out/target/product/generic/dex_bootjars for aosp_arm. That .art is then passed to dex2oatd as --boot-image=out/target/product/generic/dex_bootjars/system/framework/boot.art when we run dex_preopt on other apks and jars. However I got this kind of errors:
dex2oatd F  8657  8657 art/runtime/gc/space/image_space.cc:146] Failed to load image 'out/target/product/generic/dex_bootjars/system/framework/boot.art': Failed to open oat file 'out/target/product/generic/system/framework/boot.oat' referenced from image out/target/product/generic/dex_bootjars/system/framework/boot.art:

It seems somehow 'out/target/product/generic/system/framework/boot.oat'  got hard-coded into out/target/product/generic/dex_bootjars/system/framework/boot.art. I don't know why, for in my change we didn't pass this path to the above build command any longer.
Also It seems to me we shouldn't embed the build out  path into a file that would be installed to the device.
Any idea?

Is it possible that LOCAL_DEX_PREOPT_IMAGE is set to any other value in an Android.mk?
